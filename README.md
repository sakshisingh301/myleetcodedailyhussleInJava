I started this year by promising myself I’d stay consistent with coding—like going to the gym, but for my brain. And now here I am, grinding every single day, not just for interviews, but to actually get it. It’s become my daily brain cardio. Honestly, it’s so addictive that skipping one day gives me a mini panic attack. Which is kind of what I wanted, because who needs caffeine when your own guilt keeps you awake and coding?
