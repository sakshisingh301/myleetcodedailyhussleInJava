#  Love and hate relationship between me and leetcode

At the start of this year, I made a promise to myself:  
**Stay consistent with coding.**  

Not just for interview prep.  
Not just for solving problems on the surface.  
But to truly **understand concepts deeply** and train my brain like it’s at the gym. 🏋️‍♀️  

## The Grind
- Coding every single day 💻  
- Treating it like **brain cardio** 🫀  
- Building the habit so strong that skipping one day feels like…  
  > *a mini panic attack* (low-key, that’s what I wanted 😅)

##  Why?
Because who needs caffeine when your own guilt keeps you awake and coding at 2 AM?
