# 🧠 Love and hate relationship between me and leetcode

At the start of this year, I made a promise to myself:  
**Stay consistent with coding.**  

Not just for interview prep.  
Not just for solving problems on the surface.  
But to truly **understand concepts deeply** and train my brain like it’s at the gym. 🏋️‍♀️  

## 🚀 The Grind
- Coding every single day 💻  
- Treating it like **brain cardio** 🫀  
- Building the habit so strong that skipping one day feels like…  
  > *a mini panic attack* (low-key, that’s what I wanted 😅)

## 🔥 Why?
Because who needs caffeine when your own guilt keeps you awake and coding at 2 AM?  

## 🌟 The Vibe
It’s not just practice anymore—  
it’s addictive, it’s fun, and it’s my daily dose of problem-solving endorphins.  
Consistency is the new motivation.
